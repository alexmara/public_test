You will find attached an image (org_create.jpg). Using this image as a reference, create a
HTML page + CSS styling.
Notes:
- Focus on CSS and overall usability
- Handle form validation styling
- Implementation must be responsive
- Try to organize your CSS, it’s best to use a preprocessor like SASS
- It’s ok to use a framework if you want to
- Implementation should work in all new browsers, on desktop and mobile
- Do not worry that you do not have the icons in the attached image, use some reference
  ones.
The overall quality of work, organization and attention to details are very important. If you have
any questions, do not hesitate to let me know.
Good Luck!
